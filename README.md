## Dotfiles 

Dotfiles for [Z shell][1], [Vim][2], [tmux][3], and [Git][4].

Used yet not guaranteed to work on Debian-based and RPM-based Linuxes as well
as on OS X and FreeBSD. 

Run `./setup.sh` to perform simple setup tasks.

Some of the programs this dotfiles are written for might not be installed on
your system. On Debian-based sytems `apt-get install zsh tmux vim-nox git-core`
will do the trick. To make Z shell your default login shell use `chsh`.
